# âœ… DSA Level 2 â€“ Sorting (Day 3 Completed)

## ðŸ”„ Sorting Algorithms I have completed:

- âœ… **Selection Sort**
  - Sorted in increasing order
  - Also done in decreasing order
  - Sorted characters (like char arrays)

- âœ… **Bubble Sort**
  - Sorted in increasing order from the end
  - Also done in decreasing order
  - Sorted character arrays too
  - Added early exit optimization using `swapped = false`

- âœ… **Insertion Sort**
  - Done in increasing order from the last index
  - Also completed in decreasing order
  - Character sorting is done too

## ðŸ“š Homework Completed:
- For all sorting algorithms:
  - Implemented in both increasing and decreasing order
  - Also did sorting of characters
  - Used optimization in bubble sort
