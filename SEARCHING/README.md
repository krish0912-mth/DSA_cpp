# 📁 SEARCHING - DSA C++ Practice

This folder contains searching algorithm implementations as per the DSA roadmap.

## ✅ Algorithms Implemented:

### 2. Binary Search
- Binary search on ascending sorted array
- Binary search on descending sorted array

## 📌 Notes:
- Each code is implemented in C++ and follows clean, readable structure.
- Covered multiple variations to build strong logic base.
