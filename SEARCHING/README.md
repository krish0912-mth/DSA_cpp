This folder contains my implementation of searching algorithms using C++.

## ✅ Completed:

- Binary Search on Descending Array
- First Occurrence of a Target
- Last Occurrence of a Target
- Search Insert Position (Insert Target if Not Present)

## ⏳ Pending:
- Linear Search (coming soon)

## 📌 Notes:
- Covered real interview-level binary search variations.
- Clean and modular code written in C++.
- Each code is properly commented and structured.
- More variations will be added as I go further.
